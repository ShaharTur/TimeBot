#Introducing TimeBot ! 

As i continue to learn and becoming more knowledgeable about the field of data and data analysis , i wanted to create something different . 
as you read the title you probably understand that i created a bot on Discord . 
this bot collecting data for the users joining my server and with the help of Google api's the data is saving on a csv file which is a spreadsheet on google . 
the bot also got the !time command which allows a user to know how long the user has been on a voice channel in my server because Discord actually doesn't have this feature at all . 

it is only the begining of the bot , and more to come in the near future . stay tuned !
